# Weight-spaces-calculation-and-basis-vector-transformation-for-irreducible-representations-of-F4
In my thesis "On branching rules for exceptional simple Lie groups" I was trying to derive branching rules from F4 to B4. In that way I faced with a problem to describe all weights and weight spaces' dimentions for B4 and F4 irreducible representations. Also I needed to make a lot of calculations in terms of basis vectors.
